It took me every tuesday of the week, the whole semester, try to get the honors credit for this class.

Got all 7 of the milestones except the last one.  (Yes the milestone 8 won't produce the correct results.)

I ENDED UP 'NOT' GETTING THE HONORS CREDIT. BUT I HOPE YOU FIND THESE PROJECTS HELPFUL UNLIKE ME. 

Also only do the honors option for this class if you have no other option. :/ :/ it sucks
